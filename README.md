Introduction to logic programming with Ruby.

## Data types
Everything in Ruby is an object. Objects have built-in methods you can call on them.

### Integers
* To represent whole numbers
* Can do standard arithmetic

```
4. class             # => Integer 
1 + 2               # => 3
2 * 4                # => 8
4 / 2               # => 2
```

* Also has custom methods built-in
```
20.even?              # => true
20.odd?               # => false
```

* You can convert numbers to strings
```
1984.to_s          # => "1984"
```
### Floats

* To represent decimal numbers
```
3.14.class         # => Float
1.23 + 2.1         # => 3.33
```

* Has itâ€™s own built-in methods
```
3.14.round         # => 3
```
